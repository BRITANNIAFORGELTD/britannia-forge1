# URGENT GITHUB DEPLOYMENT FIX

## CRITICAL ISSUE
- Vercel is pulling commit `67993e9` (old)
- GitHub has latest commit `c009f62` (new)
- This is a GitHub-Vercel webhook sync issue

1. Go to GitHub repo → Settings → Webhooks
2. Find Vercel webhook (vercel.com)
3. Click "Edit" → "Redeliver" recent payloads
4. Or delete and reconnect Vercel integration

### Option 2: Manual Deploy from Vercel
1. Vercel Dashboard → Create Deployment
2. Select "main" branch
3. Select commit `c009f62` manually
4. Deploy with "Use existing Build Cache" UNCHECKED

### Option 3: Nuclear Option - Reconnect Integration
1. Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Git Integration
2. Disconnect GitHub repository
3. Reconnect GitHub repository
4. Redeploy

## PREVENTIVE MEASURES
- Check webhook exists in GitHub repo settings

## TECHNICAL DETAILS
The issue is NOT in the code - it's in the deployment sync between GitHub and Vercel.

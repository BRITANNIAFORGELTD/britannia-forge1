# FORCE NETLIFY REBUILD

## THE REAL PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
Your Replit build works perfectly and creates:
- `dist/assets/index-3MXvLAfX.css` ✅ 
- `dist/assets/index-BcHB3zp2.js` ✅

But your live website is looking for old files:
- `dist/assets/index-DxGDOImN.js` ❌ (old build)
- `dist/assets/index-scPRR13d.css` ❌ (old build)

## SOLUTION: FORCE NETLIFY TO REBUILD

### METHOD 1: Trigger GitHub Change
Make a small change to force GitHub to trigger Netlify rebuild:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Edit any file (like README.md)
3. Add a single character
4. Commit the change
5. This will trigger automatic Netlify rebuild

### METHOD 2: Manual Netlify Rebuild
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Find your britannia-forge site
3. Go to "Deploys" tab
4. Click "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"

### METHOD 3: Clear Build Cache
1. In Netlify dashboard
2. Go to "Site settings"
3. "Build & deploy" section
4. Click "Clear cache and retry deploy"

The issue is that Netlify has cached the old build files and hasn't regenerated with your new package.json dependencies.

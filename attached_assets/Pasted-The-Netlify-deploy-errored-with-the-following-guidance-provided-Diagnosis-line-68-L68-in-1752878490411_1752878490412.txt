The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis

[line 68](#L68) indicates a build failure due to Rollup being unable to resolve the import "@radix-ui/react-radio-group".

### Solution

To resolve this issue:
1. Verify that "@radix-ui/react-radio-group" is listed in the `package.json` file or was committed to the repository.
2. If the package is included, explicitly add it to the `build.rollupOptions.external` configuration in the project's Vite configuration.

The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
The build failed with the following error message:
- **Error**: Build failed with exit code 1.
- **Location**: Failed during the stage 'building site'.
- **Specific Error**: Rollup failed to resolve import "@stripe/react-stripe-js" from "/client/src/pages/checkout.tsx".

### Solution
1. **Verify the Package**: Make sure that the package "@stripe/react-stripe-js" is listed in the `dependencies` or `devDependencies` section of the `package.json` file or was committed to the repository.
2. **Add to External Configuration**: If the package is verified, explicitly add it to `build.rollupOptions.external` to avoid Rollup failure in Vite.

By confirming the presence of the package in the `package.json` file and adding it to the external configuration if necessary, you should be able to resolve the Rollup failure and successfully build the site.

Prompt for AI Code Generator: Professional Consultation on Vercel Monorepo Deployment Failure
Objective:

This is a formal request for a professional consultation. We require your expert analysis and a detailed solution for a persistent deployment failure on the Vercel platform. Our goal is to deploy our existing, high-quality application without compromising its architecture.

1. Current Project Architecture & Status
We have a sophisticated web application for "Britannia Forge" with the following structure, managed in a GitHub repository:

Monorepo Structure: The project is organized into a "monorepo" with distinct folders for the frontend and backend:

client/: Contains the entire frontend application, built with React and Vite.

server/: Contains the backend API, built with Express.js.

Configuration Files: The project currently has a single, comprehensive package.json and package-lock.json located in the root directory. These files contain all dependencies for both the client and server.

Code Quality: The existing codebase is professionally written and includes a full authentication system, database integration, and an advanced quote engine. Our goal is to deploy this application, not replace it with a simpler version.

2. The Deployment Environment & The Problem
We are using a standard, professional deployment pipeline: GitHub -> Vercel.

Vercel Project Configuration: The Vercel project is configured as follows to target our frontend application:

Framework Preset: Vite

Root Directory: client

The Persistent Error: Despite having the correct settings, every deployment fails with the exact same error message in the build logs:

sh: line 1: vite: command not found
Error: Command "vite build" exited with 127

3. The Request for Consultation
We have confirmed that our Vercel settings appear correct and that our GitHub repository contains all the necessary code. The issue seems to be a fundamental conflict between our project's monorepo structure and Vercel's build process.

We require your professional analysis and a recommended solution. Please address the following points:

Root Cause Analysis: Based on the provided architecture and the Vercel error message, what is your professional diagnosis of the root cause of the vite: command not found error?

Proposed Solution: What is the standard, professional industry solution for correctly deploying a monorepo with a separate frontend application (like our client folder) on Vercel?

Implementation Plan: Please provide a clear, step-by-step plan detailing the exact file modifications and/or additions required to fix this issue. This should include the precise contents of any new files needed (e.g., a package.json for the client) and any necessary adjustments to the root package.json.

Our priority is to maintain the high quality of our existing application. We need a solution that is robust, scalable, and follows best practices for modern web development.

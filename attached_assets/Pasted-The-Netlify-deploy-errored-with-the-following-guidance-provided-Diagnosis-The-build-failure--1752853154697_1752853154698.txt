The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is due to the parsing error of the `tsconfig.node.json` file in the Vite build process.

**Solution:**
1. The error indicates that the `tsconfig.node.json` file is missing. Verify that the `tsconfig.node.json` file is present in the `/client` directory of your repository.

2. If the `tsconfig.node.json` file is part of your project, ensure that it is committed to the repository. If it's missing, add the `tsconfig.node.json` file to your repository.

3. Make sure that the path to the `tsconfig.node.json` file is correct and matches the actual file location in your project.

By addressing these points, you should be able to resolve the parsing error related to the `tsconfig.node.json` file.

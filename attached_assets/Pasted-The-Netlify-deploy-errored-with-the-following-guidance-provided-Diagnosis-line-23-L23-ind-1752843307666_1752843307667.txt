The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
[line 23](#L23) indicates a failure during the installation of dependencies with a non-zero exist code, leading to a build failure. Specifically, [line 24](#L24) to [line 31](#L31) show an npm error `E404` suggesting that the package `@radix-ui/react-button@^1.1.0` is not found in the registry.

### Solution
1. Verify that the package `@radix-ui/react-button` with version `^1.1.0` is correctly spelled and exists in the `package.json` file or was committed to the repository.
2. If the package is correct, ensure it is a public package available on npmjs.org.
3. If the package is correct and public, it could be a temporary issue. Retrigger the build to see if the problem persists.

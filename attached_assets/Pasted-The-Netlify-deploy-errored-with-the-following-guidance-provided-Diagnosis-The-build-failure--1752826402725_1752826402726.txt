The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis:
The build failure is due to a dependency installation error during the npm install stage.

The specific error is:
- Line 23: `npm error code E404`
- Line 24: `npm error 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/@radix-ui%2freact-button - Not found`
- Line 26: `npm error 404 '@radix-ui/react-button@^1.1.0' is not in this registry`

### Solution:
1. Verify that the package `@radix-ui/react-button` is correctly specified in the `package.json` file or was committed to the repository.
2. If the package is a private package, ensure that the appropriate authentication is set up to access it.
3. If the package should be available on npm, check for any typos in the package name or version.
4. If the package is not found or is a private package, consider checking the package name, version, or availability.

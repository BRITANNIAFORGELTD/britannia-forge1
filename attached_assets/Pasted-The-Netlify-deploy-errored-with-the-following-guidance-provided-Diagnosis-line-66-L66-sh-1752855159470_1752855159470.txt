The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
[line 66](#L66) shows that the build failed.
[line 67](#L67) indicates a Rollup error in resolving an import for "@assets/logo_1752637323721.png" in "/opt/build/repo/client/src/pages/about.tsx".

**Error Type:**
Rollup failed to resolve the import which can break the application at runtime.

**Cause:**
The import for "@assets/logo_1752637323721.png" in "/opt/build/repo/client/src/pages/about.tsx" is not resolved by Rollup.

**Solution:**
To fix this issue:
1. Ensure that the file `@assets/logo_1752637323721.png` exists in the correct location within your project.
2. If the file exists, verify that Rollup can resolve the import path correctly.
3. If the file is part of the project, add it to `build.rollupOptions.external` to explicitly tell Rollup to handle it.

If the file is missing, add it to the project and ensure it is committed to the repository.

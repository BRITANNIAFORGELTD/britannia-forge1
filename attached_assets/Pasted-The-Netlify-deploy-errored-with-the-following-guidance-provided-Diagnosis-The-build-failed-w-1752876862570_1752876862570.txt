The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed with the error `ENOENT: no such file or directory` while trying to load a specific image (`logo_1752637323721.png`) in a file (`src/pages/about.tsx`) during the build process.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the `logo_1752637323721.png` file is present in the correct directory (`/client/src/assets/`) and that it is committed to the repository.
2. Ensure that the path to the image file is correct and matches the actual location in the project.
3. If the image file exists in the repository, confirm that the casing of the filename in the import statement matches the actual filename in the directory.
4. Update the import path in the `src/pages/about.tsx` file to point to the correct location or correct filename of the image file.
5. Re-run the build process after making these adjustments to resolve the `ENOENT` error.

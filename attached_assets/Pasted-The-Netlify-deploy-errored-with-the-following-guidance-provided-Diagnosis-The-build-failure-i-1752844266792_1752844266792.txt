The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
The build failure is due to a "Failed to load PostCSS config" error. Specifically, it states "Cannot find module 'tailwindcss'." This error occurs during the build process when trying to load the PostCSS configuration.

This error is in line [63](#L63) to [77](#L77) of the build log.

### Solution
1. **Verify TailwindCSS Dependency**:
   - Ensure that TailwindCSS is listed as a dependency in the `package.json` file of the project.
   - Make sure that TailwindCSS is included in the `dependencies` or `devDependencies`.

2. **Install TailwindCSS**:
   - If TailwindCSS is not in the dependencies, you need to install it by running:
     ```bash
     npm install tailwindcss
     ```

3. **Commit Changes**:
   - Ensure that any changes made to the `package.json` file or dependencies are committed to the repository.

By verifying that TailwindCSS is in the `package.json` and installing it if needed, the build should be able to find the required module during the build process.

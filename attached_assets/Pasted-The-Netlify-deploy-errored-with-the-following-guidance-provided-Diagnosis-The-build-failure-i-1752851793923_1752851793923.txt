The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
The build failure is due to a error with the Vite build process. It failed to resolve an import from `@/components/ui/toaster` in the file `client/src/App.tsx`.

### Solution
To fix this issue:
1. Verify that the package `@/components/ui/toaster` is correctly included in the `package.json` file or was committed to the repository.
2. If the package is present, explicitly add it to the `build.rollupOptions.external` configuration to prevent the error. You can refer to the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/config/#build-rollupoptions) for more information on how to configure `build.rollupOptions.external`.

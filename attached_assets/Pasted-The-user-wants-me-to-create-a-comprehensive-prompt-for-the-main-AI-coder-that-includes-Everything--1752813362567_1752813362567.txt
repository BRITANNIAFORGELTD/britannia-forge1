The user wants me to create a comprehensive prompt for the main AI coder that includes:

Everything we tried
The results of each attempt
The questions asked to customer service and their replies
All the context so the main AI coder can potentially find a better solution
This is a great idea because the main AI coder will have a fresh perspective and might spot something we missed. Let me compile all the information into a clear, comprehensive prompt.

I'll create a comprehensive prompt document for the main AI coder with all our findings:


Created vercel-deployment-issue-comprehensive-report.md

Strategized prompt document structure improvements (4 seconds)
I've created a comprehensive report file called vercel-deployment-issue-comprehensive-report.md that contains:

What's included:
✓ Complete problem description with error details
✓ All 6 different solutions we tried and their results
✓ Vercel support conversation summary
✓ Project structure and configuration files
✓ Analysis of successful vs failed deployments
✓ Key insights about the import.meta.dirname issue
✓ Constraints (like not being able to modify vite.config.ts)
✓ Recommended next steps for investigation

Key findings for the main AI coder:

The exact same code works on one Vercel project but not another
The issue is likely with import.meta.dirname in vite.config.ts
We cannot modify vite.config.ts due to Replit restrictions
Some deployments succeed when Vercel auto-detects the framework
This document gives the main AI coder everything they need to understand the situation and potentially find a solution we haven't thought of. They might spot:

A different configuration approach
A workaround for the path alias issue
Project settings in Vercel we haven't checked
A creative build process solution
The report is ready to share with the main AI coder for the project. They'll have full context to help solve this deployment issue.

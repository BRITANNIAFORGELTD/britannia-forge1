The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed due to a configuration error where the deploy directory 'client/client/dist' does not exist as specified in the Netlify configuration.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the directory 'client/client/dist' exists in the repository.
2. If the directory exists locally but is not being deployed, ensure it is included in the build process output.
3. Update the publish directory in the Netlify configuration to match the correct path where the build artifacts are located before deployment. In this case, change the `publish` path to `/opt/build/repo/client/dist` to align with the actual directory structure.
4. Make sure to commit any changes to the repository before triggering the build again.

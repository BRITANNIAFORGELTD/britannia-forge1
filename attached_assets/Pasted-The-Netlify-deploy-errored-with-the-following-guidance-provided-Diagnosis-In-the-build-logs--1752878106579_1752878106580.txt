The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
In the build logs, the error points to a failed build with a message stating that Rollup failed to resolve an import for "react-icons/fa" in the file "client/src/components/navigation/footer.tsx". This issue is most likely unintended and can break the application at runtime.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the package "react-icons" including the "fa" component is included in the package.json file or was committed to the repository.
2. To resolve this, explicitly add the "react-icons/fa" module to the `build.rollupOptions.external` configuration.
3. Ensure that the necessary configuration is in place to prevent Rollup from encountering import resolution issues.

Following these steps should help resolve the build failure related to the Rollup import resolution error.

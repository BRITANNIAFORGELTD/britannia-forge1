# VERCEL PRODUCTION OVERRIDE FIX

## CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED
Your Vercel settings show:
- **Production Overrides**: `britannia-forge-it3k-9o55d9lzv-britannia-forge.vercel.app`
- **Project Settings**: `cd client && npx vite build`

Vercel is using **Production Overrides** instead of your **Project Settings**.

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

### Step 1: Clear Production Overrides
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → Build & Development Settings
2. Find the **Production Overrides** section
3. **CLEAR/RESET** all production overrides to use Project Settings
4. **SAVE** changes

### Step 2: Force Fresh Deploy
1. Go to Deployments tab
2. Click "Redeploy" 
3. **UNCHECK** "Use existing Build Cache"
4. Deploy

### Step 3: Verify Settings
After clearing overrides, verify:
- Build Command: `cd client && npx vite build`
- Output Directory: `client/dist`
- Root Directory: (empty)
- Node.js Version: 22.x

## TECHNICAL EXPLANATION
Production overrides take precedence over project settings. Your project settings are correct, but Vercel is ignoring them due to cached production overrides from previous deployments.

## EXPECTED RESULT
- Vercel will use your updated project settings
- Build will pull latest commit `c009f62`
- Website will deploy successfully
